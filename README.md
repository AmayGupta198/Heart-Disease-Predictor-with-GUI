# Heart-Disease-Predictor-with-GUI
Heart Disease Predictor project is a sophisticated healthcare
application that combines a user-friendly Graphical User Interface
(GUI) with a powerful machine learning model.

This model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of medical
records, which includes a wide range of health-related features such
as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) serves as the front end of this
project, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for
individuals to input their personal health information.

# Dataset Description
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases:
Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76
attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published
experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field

refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is an integer-
valued: 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

# Objective
The primary objective is to create a tool that empowers individuals
to proactively assess their heart disease risk and make informed
decisions about their health.

Using machine learning model, which can reliably predict heart disease
risk based on various health parameters is a complex task that
requires a high level of accuracy.

Integrating the GUI with the machine learning model to provide
real-time risk assessments.
